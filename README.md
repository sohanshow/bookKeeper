This is another web application that I developed to bookmark a portal using JavaScript, HTML, CSS to make a local storage of the bookmarks and view them as icons on a browser


# How to Install and Run
1. Download zip or git clone 
2. Open the project folder
3. Double-click on index.html to open the web-page in your browser
